 1. How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 50 
 consecutive push operations on an empty array which starts out at capacity
 8, assuming that the array will double in capacity each time a new item 
 is added to an already full dynamic array? As N (ie. the number of pushes)
 grows large, under this strategy for resizing, what is the average big -
 oh complexity for a push?

 

8 + 9 + 7 + 17 + 15 + 33 + 17 = 106.
 Unit cost is 106.
 
This will O(1)+ complexity.
 
Average = 106/50 = 2.12

 
2. How many cost units are spent in the entire process of performing 50
 consecutive push operations on an empty array which starts out at capacity
 8, assuming that the array will grow by a constant 2 spaces each time a new
 item is added to an already full dynamic array? As N (ie. the number of 
 pushes) grows large, under this strategy for resizing, what is the average
 big - oh complexity for a push?

 

8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 + 18 + 20 + 22 + 24 + 26 + 28 + 30 + 32 + 34 + 36
 + 38 + 40 + 42 + 44 + 46 + 48 + 50 = 650
 
Unit cost is 650.
 This will be O(n) complexity.
 
Average = 650/50 = 13
